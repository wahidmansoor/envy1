## 2. Core Features

### AI Assistant
The AI Assistant is the central feature of the application, designed to provide intelligent support for various oncology-related tasks.

#### Capabilities
- **Medical Query Answering:**  Users can ask medical questions related to oncology, and the AI Assistant provides concise and relevant answers. For example, a doctor might ask, "What are the first-line treatment options for stage III non-small cell lung cancer?" and receive an evidence-based summary.
- **Treatment Plan Suggestions:** Based on patient profiles and medical best practices, the AI Assistant can suggest potential treatment plans. For instance, inputting patient characteristics and cancer type could yield a list of recommended regimens with supporting evidence.
- **Guideline Explanations:** The AI can explain complex oncology guidelines in simpler terms, making it easier for doctors to understand and apply them in practice. For example, it can break down the latest NCCN guidelines for breast cancer screening.

#### Integration with Oncology Handbook
The AI Assistant is deeply integrated with a comprehensive oncology handbook. When a user asks a question, the AI:
1. **Searches the Handbook:**  Utilizes the RAG system to retrieve relevant information from the oncology handbook.
2. **Provides Direct Answers:** Delivers direct, concise answers based on the handbook content.
3. **Suggests Related Questions:** Based on the context of the query and the structure of different oncology modules within the handbook, the AI suggests follow-up questions to explore related topics in more depth. For example, after answering a question about chemotherapy for breast cancer, it might suggest questions about targeted therapy or immunotherapy for the same condition.

### Database and RAG System
The application leverages a robust database and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to ensure efficient and accurate data handling.

#### Supabase
Supabase is used as the primary database to store:
- **Chat History:** All interactions with the AI Assistant are logged and stored, allowing users to review past queries and responses. This history is crucial for tracking consultations and improving the AI's learning over time.
- **Documents:**  The oncology handbook, treatment protocols, and other relevant medical documents are stored in Supabase. This centralized repository ensures that all information is easily accessible and up-to-date.
- **Treatment Protocols:** Detailed treatment protocols, including NCCN guidelines and BC Cancer protocols, are stored and indexed for quick retrieval by the AI Assistant and search functionalities.

#### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System
The RAG system is critical for efficient data retrieval. It works by:
1. **Retrieving:** When a user makes a query, the system first retrieves relevant documents or document chunks from the Supabase database based on semantic similarity to the query.
2. **Augmenting:** The retrieved information is then used to augment the AI's knowledge base in real-time.
3. **Generating:** Finally, the AI generates a response that is informed by both its pre-existing knowledge and the newly retrieved information. This ensures that the answers are not only accurate but also contextually relevant and up-to-date with the latest information in the database.

### Tools Bar Widget
The Tools Bar Widget is a customizable sidebar that provides quick access to essential utilities and information.

#### Features
- **Calculators:** Integrated medical calculators for various oncology-specific calculations, such as BSA (Body Surface Area), creatinine clearance, and chemotherapy dose calculators.
- **Important Lab Results:** A section to quickly input and view important lab results, with flags for abnormal values. This helps doctors monitor critical patient data at a glance.
- **Red Flags:** A customizable list of red flag symptoms and signs in oncology, providing a quick reference for critical indicators that require immediate attention.
- **Customization Options:** Users can customize the Tools Bar Widget to include the tools and information most relevant to their practice. This might include adding specific calculators, frequently checked lab values, or personalized red flag lists.

#### Integration with Main App
The Tools Bar Widget is seamlessly integrated into the main application interface, always accessible alongside the primary content areas. This ensures that these essential tools are readily available without disrupting the user's workflow.

### Search and Filters
Robust search and filter functionalities are implemented throughout the application to enhance information discovery.

#### In-App Search Filter
A universal search bar is available within the app, allowing users to search across all components, including the AI Assistant responses, handbook content, treatment protocols, and more. This ensures that users can quickly find information regardless of its location within the app.

#### Tag-Based Search for Guidelines and Resources
Guidelines and resources are tagged with relevant keywords (e.g., cancer type, treatment modality, stage). This tag-based system allows for:
- **Efficient Filtering:** Users can filter guidelines and resources by specific tags to narrow down search results quickly.
- **Targeted Searches:** Doctors can perform highly targeted searches, such as "NCCN guidelines for breast cancer, HER2 positive" to find precisely what they need.

### User Experience Enhancements
The application is designed with a focus on user experience, incorporating several enhancements to make it intuitive and efficient to use.

#### Loading States and Error Messages
- **Loading States:** Clear visual indicators (e.g., spinners, progress bars) are used to inform users when the application is loading data or processing queries. This provides feedback and manages user expectations during processing times.
- **Error Messages:**  User-friendly and informative error messages are displayed to guide users when issues occur. These messages are designed to be actionable, helping users understand what went wrong and how to resolve the problem.

#### Tooltips and Accessibility Features
- **Tooltips:**  Contextual tooltips are provided throughout the interface to explain the function of icons, buttons, and less obvious UI elements. This helps new users learn the application quickly and ensures that all users can easily understand the interface.
- **Accessibility Features:** The application is designed with accessibility in mind, adhering to WCAG guidelines. This includes features such as:
    - **Keyboard Navigation:** Full keyboard navigation to ensure users can operate the app without a mouse.
    - **Screen Reader Compatibility:** Semantic HTML and ARIA attributes are used to ensure compatibility with screen readers for visually impaired users.
